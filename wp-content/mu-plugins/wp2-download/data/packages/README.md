# WP2 Package Manifests

This directory contains manifests for WordPress installables, organized by kind:

- `mu-plugins/` — Must-use plugins
- `plugins/` — Standard plugins
- `themes/` — Themes

Each manifest references the shared schema (`schema.json`) and describes the package's origin, versioning, and metadata. See subdirectory README files for details.
